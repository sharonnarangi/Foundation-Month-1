 Foundation-week1

This repository is part of my personal self-discovery journey. Week 1 is focused on foundation groundwork — both technically and internally. The goal is to build a solid base using semantic HTML and begin exploring how it will tie into future JavaScript functionality.

 Week 1 Focus

> “How do semantic HTML elements tie into JavaScript later on?”

This week, I will explore the meaning and structure of semantic HTML tags and how they can support cleaner, more meaningful JavaScript interactions. I am also reflecting on how this mirrors the process of building a strong personal foundation in life.

What’s Included

- `index.html`: A simple UI layout built with semantic HTML.
- `README.md`: This file.
- [Branch: `week1-foundation`](): Work-in-progress code and daily commits.
- Progress updates tracked in a [Notion/Google doc]() (shared separately).

 Weekly Milestones

- [x] Create Google/Notion progress tracker
- [x] Set up GitHub repo + `README.md`
- [x] Build semantic HTML layout
- [ ] Reflect on JS integration with semantic elements
- [ ] Write weekly insight summary

Why This Matters

Semantic HTML helps structure content meaningfully — improving accessibility, maintainability, and clarity. As I grow in my development journey, I aim to write code that is clean, expressive, and intentional — just like the foundation I’m building for myself as a person.

Reflections

- "Divs can’t hold meaning if there’s no intention — just like life."
- "Foundations are about clarity — in code and in identity."
